So this is a firmware for the transmitter part of the project. Earlier version of the firmware used two multivibrators, but it prooved to be less flexible (and even more expensive) than a ÂµC.

# How to build
Select attiny402 kit in vscode. It uses the official compiler from microchip (ancient version of GCC 5.3.0 or something) and something called an atpack.

* [Here they discuss how to build with avr-gcc. CRUCIAL TO READ](https://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/solved-compiling-attiny1607-or-other-0-series1-series-avr-gcc).
  * Better use [the official compiler](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-c-compilers).

# How to flash
* Grab [this](https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi).
* `sudo python ./setup.py install`
* Connect everything as described in the README.md from pyupdi.

``` sh
pyupdi.py -d tiny402 -c /dev/ttyUSB0 -f build/transmitter.hex
```
